			<h2>The Poetry of Tools</h2>
			<h3>1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</h3>
			<p>I think what Seu meant by defamiliarizing our tools is, that there have been functional archetypes that have been created over the years through the evolution of the web which has thereby lead to constraints in how one views the functionality of tools. An example she presented was the mouse- the mouse represents you, the user, and tracks your movements through the clicking and scrolling features. Now, because this is what we are used to, our expectation when we reach for our mouse is that it will instinctively mirror our interaction with the screen. Before we look at how exactly this may relate to the word poetry, let’s take a look at the definition of poetry. According to Merriam- Webster dictionary, poetry is the writing that formulates a concentrated imaginative awareness of experience in language chosen and arranged to create a specific emotional response through meaning, sound, and rhythm. Poetry is fluid, is unexpected, and is creative. In order for our tools to mirror the meaning of poetry, we have to deconstruct our relationship with our tools in the first place. I think what she means is that in order to understand the potential of our tools, we must break free from our familiarization with the tools and instead try to emote responses through these mediums.</p>

			<h3>2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</h3>
			<p>Removing function from form in my opinion is exploring the web truly through the medium of exploration and creativity. As Seu mentioned it’s “reimagining the outward facing elements of our tools and browsers”, but it is also reconfiguring our relationship with the medium. I see this category to represent something that maybe isn’t utilitarian and challenges our instincts of what is going on. An example that came to mind when I read about this category was a website I encountered a while ago. It is essential to imitate the “hacker” scenes that show up in movies. There is no purpose to the website that is functional, it is an expression to elicit an idea. On the other hand, performing data as I interpreted is, is about representing factual information and valid data in a sense. But it was interesting watching A sort of Joy at MoMA and not being able to understand or retain any information. The dichotomy of the intention versus the product was interesting to see within each category. All the different interactions question our thoughts and that is how I saw them as embodying poetry.</p>

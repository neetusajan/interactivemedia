        <p>
          My intial research consisted of looking at images and websites for inspiration. I came across <a href="https://leonard.agency/">this website</a> and was drawn to the soft colour palette. 
          <br>
          It also reminded me of my <a href="https://blobmixer.14islands.com/view?ambient=0&angle1=0.63&angle2=0.4&angle3=0.51&angle4=0.43&ccRougness=0&clearColor=%23f8f8f8&clearcoat=0&color1=%2300b1bc&color2=%23e985fd&color3=%23ff7100&color4=%230000f3&color5=%23ff0000&decay1=1&decay3=1&dist1=8.6&dist2=9.27&dist3=14.07&dist4=4.93&distort=1&dynEnv=false&envMap=0&flatShading=false&floor=false&floorColor=rgba%2811%2C39%2C43%2C1%29&floorEnvMap=0.37&floorMetalness=0&floorOpacity=0.27&floorRoughness=0.15&floorSize=0&floorY=-0.4&frequency=0.76&gradient=white&int1=3.03&int2=1.15&int3=2.63&int4=5&int5=0.63&ior=2.33&lights%5B0%5D=1&lights%5B1%5D=2&lights%5B2%5D=3&lights%5B3%5D=4&metalness=0&numWaves=1&opacity=1&penum1=1&penum2=1&penum3=1&poleAmount=1&reflectivity=1&roughness=1&rshad=false&rx=4&ry=0.37&scale=1.5&segments=512&shadow1=false&shadow2=false&shadowBias1=false&shadowFocus1=1&shadowMap=false&sky=false&speed=0.15&surfaceDistort=3.1&surfaceFrequency=0.28&surfaceSpeed=0.42&title=Neetu%20Sajan%20&transmission=0.15&useGradient=true&uv=true&wireframe=false&x1=-5&x2=-2.73&x3=0.67&x4=3.07&y1=0.07&y2=-6.67&y3=2.67&z1=1.93&z2=5.73&z3=4.6&z4=3.53&z5=6.2">slef-portait</a> that I did at the beginning of the course. Clearly, I have a type and these colours really do describe me! I thought it was ironic but it symbolizes where I started at the beginning of the course, to everything I have learned so I wanted to incorporate similar colours. 
          <br>
          As this is an index and the primary purpose of it is to clearly display our work, I also wanted to make sure to keep that in mind during the designing process and make sure that it was easy to navigate. These were some of the other websites that also inspired me. I was also inspired by the colors and soft movement in<a href="https://antara.studio/"> this website </a> as well as the mouse interaction in <a href="https://duallstudio.com/">this one.</a>

            As the colours were my primary focus, I made a guide to visualize the colours.

                I did focus on the usability factor while implenting my design and wanted to keep the elements organized. I ended up animating the circles in the background as well as adding transitions to the colours to create movement.

                  Overall, I really enjoyed the process of creating this. But, to refine the project, I will go back and add more animations and transitions to make the experience more interactive.

			<h2>How to Crit</h2>
			<h3>1. What are some challenges you face when giving a critique?</h3>
			<p>A challenge I face when giving a critique, like Goldstein mentioned is separating the art vs the artist. It often feels as though the critique is directed at the person who made the work rather than the work itself. The challenge is in making the critique  impersonal and not taking the comments to heart and rather than looking at it as feedback to improve your work in the future. One way I try to deflect that association is to refer to the work itself or speak to the art specifically while doing the critique. Another challenge I face is being over critical of the validity of my opinions as well as formulating what I think concisely. Nerves sometimes get the better of me and ironically, I make the critique personal as well wondering how others may feel or view me. As artists, our own work is in a way a depiction of ourselves and our ideas which is why I think it's hard to distance our work from ourselves. </p>

			<h3>2. How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?</h3>
			<p>As far as handling critiques that I disagree with, being open and approaching the critique as a place to further understand what the person may be saying even if you disagree is a good way to approach it. I think fostering an encouraging and supporting environment rather than a defensive one is also another way to handle critiques that one doesn’t see eye to eye with. Even if I may not agree with something, I can still appreciate and respect their perspective. I try to be objective and give meaningful feedback rather than be judgmental. Similar to what Goldstein stated: “a critique is not a competition- nobody “wins” the crit.” Another thing I’ve learned that helps ease tensions during a critique is treating it as a conversation and making it as informal as possible; the critiques that I’ve personally had bad experiences in are the ones that are more formal and that feel like a presentation.</p>

			<h3>3. Why do you think it's important to give and receive critiques?</h3>
			<p>I think it's important to give and receive critiques because we will never know what someone is thinking unless we ask to say something. An exchange in healthy conversation is a way to exchange thoughts, ideas, and information. Reflection and feedback is an extremely valuable way to gain new perspectives on your art. Everyone has their own unique experiences and ideas and may view artwork in an entirely different light than another person would which is what makes art so universal. Further understanding those unique perspectives only broaden our mindset and therefore aid our future work. Further, Like Goldstein emphasized- “critique is empowering”; I think a huge part of giving critiques is also sharing positive things and empowering and motivating one another. Although it is important to receive critical feedback, leaving a crit with affirmation that they are heading in the right direction is incredibly important as well.</p>

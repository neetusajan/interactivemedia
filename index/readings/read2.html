			<h2>What Screens Want</h2>
			<h3>1. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.</h3>
			<p>I found this article extremely interesting and thought provocative. I strongly identify with the skeuo camp for multiple reasons. The flat camp is focused on preserving the fundamentals of how screens first started out as. There is a loss in creativity and imagination when constraints are added. What makes screens and technology so intriguing is the fact that there is so much more to explore of which we have only reached the surface. I think exploration and innovation are only possible when one has the freedom to do so. Once we define an idea, we are limited the possibilities. The way I interpreted the two camps is that the flat ideological camp is living in the past while the skeuo lives in the future. While the first appreciate security, history, and unanimity; the latter appreciate possibility, abstractness, and diversity. While there are positives and negatives in both perspectives, I think moving forward requires one to lean towards skeuo.</p>

			<h3>2. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</h3>
			<p> Eadweard Muybridge took a frame of images to prove a bet to see if all four of a horse's hooves are off of the ground at any point while it gallops. Placing the side of the image by side, one can capture the movement that is occurring at the moment. Muybridge then conducted some experiments to see if he could reanimate the images. His first attempt to do so resulted in printing the high-speed photographs radially on a glass disc and spinning it while it was lit from behind. He called this invention a zoopraxiscope. This has evolved and know is known as a GIF. This was a pioneer in the world of animation as well as creating web and interaction design. I think good design within the web is effectively communicating. We are visual beings, therefore movement and actions affect the way we not only interact with the web but also how we potentially understand it. Additionally, the screen currently being a 2d surface, the use of animations and movement makes the experience of maneuvering a screen more interesting and less stagnant. An example that inspired digital design can be traced all the way back to even cave paintings. This was the first historical evidence of communication through text and images, and I believe that is important to consider because even thousands of years ago, these means of communication were vital in order to survive. </p>

			<h3>3. Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not.</h3>
			<p>I absolutely agree that screens want “flux” because as Chimero stated, “what screens want needs to match up with what we want.” At the end of the day, we are the users that are engaging with the screen, therefore it will adapt and evolve to our needs and wants. We are curious beings and are always looking for new ways to heighten things. Screens are an extremely new interface relatively, so I think not only do screens want “flux,” but by default, they will. I think this is where the role of the designer grows in importance as well. As Chimero put it- “people believe there’s an essence to the computer, that there’s something true and real and a correct way to do things. But- there is no right way. We get to choose how to aim the technology we build.” Chimero also expressed his concerns in regards to technology happening to you versus technology being something you use. In order for technology to not infiltrate our lives as  much as it already has, I think it's the role of a designer to questions the how’s and why’s of “flux.”

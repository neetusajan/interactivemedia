			<h2>Touring Complete User</h2>
			<h3>What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?</h3>
			<p>Lialina’s opinion of the word “user” is one of high regard, opposed to Don Norman’s opinion of the word. This is because Lialina believes that attempting to vilify the term “user” in the context of invisible computing and replacing it with the word “people'' can become dangerous. She specifically states, “We need to take care of this word because addressing people and not users hide the existence of two classes of people — developers and users. And if we lose this distinction, users may lose their rights and the opportunity to protect them. These rights are to demand better software,. . .'' Lialina wants to preserve the word “User” so that one can stay reminded of the fact that one is indeed using a computer and programmed systems, even during the moments when it may not be quite apparent. She also references the past and how the meaning of users at a time was used differently. But because users superseded computers,  the “model of user” has been imagined, developed, and re-invented over time.</p>

			<h3> What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</h3>
			<p> Lialina’s ideal internet user is, as she terms it is, “The General User.” The user she describes is not a rare specimen nor is it a person who is a super-user/hacker. No, in fact, Lialina describes the capacity to be a General User as being within every person so long as they “have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device. Such users will find a way to their aspiration without an app or utility programmed specifically for it.” From this, I believe she is implying that the ideal internet user is someone who doesn't necessarily need specific apps or programs to complete tasks due to their resourcefulness and/or mindset that they can complete such tasks via other mediums that aren't primarily developed solely for the task in question. Lialina provides an example of this by describing a General User who knowingly and/or unknowingly opts out of using Twitter’s app to use Twitter. Instead, the General User finds ways to achieve their twitter endeavors through the use of Firefox or Chrome browser windows. Thus, this ideal user can employ a more holistic approach to achieving their task on computers.</p>

			<h3>From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</h3>
			<p>In my own experience, I do notice that there are many web/software programs where the user fills in the gap. For instance, on Instagram, a user can edit their photos in a multitude of ways, but many people that I know choose to edit their photos in another editing app. This is either conscious or unconscious depending on the user's understanding of all the tools or tricks within their web/software program. Or the user might find that the “effects” or feature(s) they want on their Instagram picture, are not easily achievable, or at all when using the “specific” web/software program that they are users of. Another scenario where I've witnessed this dilemma is within creative software such as programs like Pro Tools or Apple’s Software Bundle (Final Cut Pro, MainStage, etc.) Many of these programs have various capabilities that far exceed a user's necessities. Yet, many users will perhaps record or edit a video on the program to later export it and do the “final work” in another program despite their primary program having the same, if not more, capabilities than the program the user is choosing to export to. Much of this is due to comfortability and ease of use in my opinion, but regardless the same “ideal user” logic is applied by using a more “general/holistic” approach to achieving tasks and how one’s web/software programs are put to use.</p>

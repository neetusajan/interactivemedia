			<h3>Why does Laurel Schwulst (Links to an external site.) advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</h3>
			<p>Laurel advocates for individual websites over social media mainly because of four factors. The first as she states is: “..Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest—are private companies that prioritize advertising above their users’ needs.” I disagree because one could argue that it may be the case that these huge corporations prioritize their users' needs more so than anything, thus why the user population is so vast and growing simultaneously. It's almost as if, Schwullt built a website for her own goals and visions, but was quickly “outperformed” by the “big corporations.” Meaning, she may very well be a scorned individual who is attempting to undermine big corporations through a positive perception that  “individual websites” are better.
			Her second factor for favoring individual sites over social media is her belief that: “this web needs to work for people instead of being powered by a small handful of big corporations—like Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google.” I agree with the sentiment, but part of me also believes that sometimes individuals may not have the same know-how to build something that works for people, especially in comparison to the big corporations who are evidently tried and true when it comes to the web “working for people.” Considering that users could be preferred to use the social media sites over an individual's website, because it, in fact, works better for them. 

			Laurel’s third premise used to conclude individual websites over that of social media is based on the notion that a personal website is independent of the platforms with massive corporations, i.e, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Although one may want to believe this, there are many websites out there that are considered “personal” while also working alongside the platforms with massive corporations; possibly because of the larger user pool found on huge platforms which a smaller personal website may be attempting to target. 

			Lastly, Schwults states: “Today I see so many websites producing communication signals ... but not actually communicating anything valuable. Using templates for web design is easy to do, but is it the best way to communicate your vision? It’s important to remember that a website is both content and structure simultaneously and that you need the ability to change both in tandem.”
			The argument is somewhat flawed because it bases its conclusion on the assumption that third-party website building apps that incorporate the use of templates, don't provide the ability to change both content and structure in tandem. In fact, I would argue that this is exactly why many people might be choosing to use easy web-building apps/software. They might be providing the creator with a better overall workflow by allowing them to make swift changes to content and structure in tandem; in addition to possibly being even more superior in regards to communicating one's “vision” to the visitors of a template-based website.</p>

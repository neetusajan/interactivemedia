 	<h3>A website is like a subway map- there are multiple destinations one can reach. At first, a subway station is daunting, especially if you are in a new city. There are numerous paths and trains one can take, it can be overwhelming. In order to receive some guidance, you turn to the map that provides an overview of the possibilities. Depending on the amount of information present as well as the intuitiveness of the map, this task is made much easier. As you ride the subway more often and get comfortable with the various routes and the map, things arenâ€™t daunting anymore but are exciting, you have the tool to navigate around an entire city! This is analogous to the mechanisms of a website in a way. As someone who may be a novice at navigating the web, it may be overwhelming. But with an easy to navigate interface and layout, this task is much easier. And as you explore, the website and understand how it works, your eyes are open to the possibilities!  </h3>

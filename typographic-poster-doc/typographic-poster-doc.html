                <p>
                    I chose the content package "Theorizing the Web" to create my poster as I thought my font would fit into the theme and content present in the document the best. My goal during the ideation process was to portray the message in a manner that was visually intriguing but also easy to read and navigate.

                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    I spent some time browsing to through artwork and other typographic posters for inpiration. The first thing that drew my eyes was an image with bright oranges and pinks- I thought this colour scheme would work well within the context and I was inspired by the retro 90's theme.

                    I was also particulary drawn to the use of vertical text as seen in the images below.

                    My goal was to create hierarchy through the vertical and hoorizontal juxtaposition of lines. The left vertical heading is an overarching heading within the two respective pages, while the hierarchy within through text sizing and colour also create additional hierarchy. I wanted to represent the information in a concise yet visually interesting manner.

                    Overall, I learned an immense amount throughout this project. Although it was rigorous, it was a fun challenge. As someone who was not very comfortable with code, I have gained a wealth of knowledge through the process.
